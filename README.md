## Development

Something you need for development.

If you don't have a node environment, get one.

1. Install grunt:

    ```
    $ npm install grunt-cli
    ```

2. Fork and clone the repo

3. Install requirements:

    ```
    $ npm install
    ```

4. Lint your code:

    ```
    $ grunt jshint
    ```

5. Build the code:

    ```
    $ grunt transport
    ```

6. Start the livereload server:

    ```
    $ grunt server
    ```

Now you open `http://localhost:8000` with your brower.
