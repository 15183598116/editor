## Development

Something you need for development.

If you don't have a node environment, get one.

1. Install grunt:

    ```
    $ npm install grunt-cli
    ```

2. Fork and clone the repo

3. Install requirements:

    ```
    $ npm install
    ```

4. Lint your code:

    ```
    $ grunt jshint
    ```

5. Build the code:

    ```
    $ grunt transport
    ```

Now you will get a `build` directory in the repo, open `build/index.html` with your browser.
